# Cell Motion Project

I used the python OpenCV package, specifically Gunnar Farnebackâ€™s algorithm for dense optical flow, to calculate flows and make histograms.

All of the code (and some explaination) is in `calculate_motion_cells.py.ipynb`

All of the data is in `data/` except it is gitignored

All of the output histograms are in `histograms/`
